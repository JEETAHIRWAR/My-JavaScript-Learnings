Isse aap webpage me animations, checking forms, loading new images, aur data submit karte time page ko refresh kiye bina hi new information show kar sakte hain.`


### History Of JavaScript: 
- JavaScript was created in `1995` by `Brendan Eich` while he was an engineer at Netscape. initially developed under the name Mocha, then renamed to `LiveScript`, and finally to JavaScript, reflecting Netscape's support of Java within its browser. the language was designed to complement Java and to appeal to non-programming language, sharing only superficial similarities.

     Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma international, leading to the standardization of the language in the form of `ECMAScript`, which continues to evolve. This standardization process ensures that JavaScript behaves predictably across different platforms.

##### { In Hindi }
- `1995 me Brendan Eich ne Netscape company ke liye JavaScript banayi thi. Shuru me iska naam Mocha tha, phir LiveScript aur finally JavaScript rakh diya gaya. JavaScript ko Java ke lightweight companion ke roop me develop kiya gaya tha, lekin ab ye dono alag-alag languages hain.`
